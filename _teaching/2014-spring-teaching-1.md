### Welcome to Computer Graphics Exercise Course!

**About the Course:**

Computer Graphics is an exciting field that explores the creation, manipulation, and rendering of images using computers. In this exercise course, students will delve into classic algorithms of computer graphics while working within the constraints of limited Python libraries, such as math, numpy, and pillow.

**Project Exploration:**

Throughout the course, students will undertake a hands-on project where they'll have the opportunity to implement and experiment with various classic algorithms in computer graphics. From rasterization to ray tracing, students will gain practical experience and insight into the fundamental techniques used in creating stunning visual imagery.

**System Development:**

To facilitate project development and interaction, the system's Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed using PyQT. This provides students with a user-friendly interface to visualize their graphics projects and interact with their implementations seamlessly.

**Final Deliverables:**

At the end of the term, students will not only submit their code but also provide a comprehensive system specification and user guidance documentation. This documentation ensures clarity and understanding of the project's functionality and usage, allowing others to replicate and build upon their work effectively.
